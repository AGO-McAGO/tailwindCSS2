Padding:    "p" for padding and the numbers "0" to "64" for the strength of the padding.
                  There's "py", "px", "pt", "pb", "pr" and "pl".
                  Usage; py-64, pt-0, p-20, e.t.c.


Borders:    "border" stands for border width, the numbers represent the strength of the width.
                  There's "border-t", "border-l", "border-r", "border-b".
                  Usage; "border-t-20", "border-4", e.t.c.
                               "border-gray-200"; to appy a colour to the border, "200" is the strength of the colour.


Margin:     It's same logic as with padding, only the letter changes; instead of "p", it's "m" which stands for margin.
