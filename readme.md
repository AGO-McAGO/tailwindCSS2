@apply: used to define/declare a class(es) in the "input.css" file which is inside the "src" folder. The class is declared with it's rules/styles, when the class is given to any tag/element in the "index.html" file, the styles of the class are applied to the element.
This helps reusability; the class declared can be given to any other element the require the same styling.
